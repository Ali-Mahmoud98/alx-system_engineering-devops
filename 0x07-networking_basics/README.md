## 4. TCP and UDP ports
**Files:** [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)

Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.

If we continue the comparison of a network device to your house, where IP address is like your postal address, UDP and TCP ports are like the windows and doors of your place. A TCP/UDP network device has 65535 ports. Some of them are officially reserved for a specific usage, some of them are known to be used for a specific usage (but nothing is officially declared) and the rest are free of use.

While the full list of ports should not be memorized, it is important to know the most used ports, let’s start by remembering 3 of them:

* 22 for SSH
* 80 for HTTP
* 443 for HTTPS

**Note** that a specific IP + port = socket.

Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
* That only shows listening sockets
* That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

Example:
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports

## 5. Is the host on the network
**Files:** [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command `ping` uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:
* Accepts a string as an argument
* Displays Usage: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed
* Ping the IP 5 times

Example:
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=12.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=13.6 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=7.83 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=11.3 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=63 time=7.57 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4006ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.570/10.682/13.679/2.546 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network
Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
It is interesting to look at the `time` value, which is the time that it took for the ICMP request to go to the `8.8.8.8` IP and come back to my host. The IP `8.8.8.8` is owned by Google, and the quickest roundtrip between my computer and Google was 7.57 ms which is pretty fast, which is a sign that the network path between my computer and Google’s datacenter is in good shape. A slow `ping` would indicate a slow network.

Next time you feel that your connection is slow, try the ping command to see what is going on!
